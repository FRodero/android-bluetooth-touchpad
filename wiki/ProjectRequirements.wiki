=Project Requirements=

===Information===

This project is part of my Bachelor Thesis. You could find it at 

== Android device: ==

  * Android version *2.1 and later*
  * *ROOT*, See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android_OS)
  * *Unmodified Bluetooth stack* (Some manufacturers modify the Bluetooth stack in Android, so the framework will not work there. Ex. HTC Desire has proven not to work!)
  
The framework was successfully tested on *Google Nexus One*.

== Host: ==

  * *Computer running Linux OS.* The framework was tested on Ubuntu, but other Linux distributions should also work.
  * Windows will not work! This is very unlikely to change.
