===Information===

This project is part of my Bachelor Thesis. You could find it at (link is coming soon). I will direct you to it for more information whenever needed.

== 1. Android device: ==

  * Android version *2.1 and later*
  * *ROOT*, See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rooting_(Android_OS) 
  * *Unmodified Bluetooth stack* Some manufacturers modify the Bluetooth stack in Android, so the framework will not work there. Ex. HTC Desire has proven not to work!
  
The framework was successfully tested on *Google Nexus One*.

== 2. Host: ==

  * *Computer running Linux OS.* The framework was tested on Ubuntu, but other Linux distributions should also work.
  * If running Ubuntu it is recommended you install *Blueman* - Bluetooth utility for Ubuntu with nice GUI. (_sudo apt-get install blueman_)
  * Windows will not work! And this is very unlikely to change.

==3. Very good Android development skills.==
